These Projects are simple projects that helped me in logic building and a little bit with syntax. 
These projects were made when I was brand new to programming so they are not optimised in any capacity, and might not work.

The descriptions of each project are given in the respective files. (The descriptions are what i could decode these files did)
I know I used to be a terrible Variable Namer, so dont mind those.
